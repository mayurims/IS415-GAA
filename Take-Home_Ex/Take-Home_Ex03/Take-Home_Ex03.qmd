# 1.0 Overview

## 1.1 Background

Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats are a crucial aspect of the Singaporean housing market. They serve as the primary form of public housing for over 80% of the population, providing affordable and accessible homes for citizens. Due to the high demand for public housing, the pricing of HDB flats is a crucial issue that affects not just the housing market but also the wider economy and society.

The pricing of HDB flats in Singapore is determined by a range of factors, including location, age, size, and condition of the flat, as well as market demand and supply. The government plays a crucial role in setting the pricing policies for HDB flats, which have significant implications for homeowners, potential buyers, and the broader economy.

Investigating and explaining the factors that affect the resale prices of public housing in Singapore is essential for several reasons. Firstly, understanding these factors can provide valuable insights into the housing market's dynamics, helping policymakers and stakeholders make informed decisions. Secondly, resale prices can significantly impact homeowners' financial well-being, so it is crucial to understand the factors that contribute to these prices. Thirdly, the study of these factors can help homeowners make informed decisions about when to sell their homes and at what price. Finally, understanding the factors that affect resale prices can help identify potential areas for intervention or policy changes to ensure the stability and affordability of public housing in Singapore. Overall, investigating and explaining the factors affecting resale prices of public housing in Singapore is an important area of research with significant implications for homeowners, policymakers, and the wider society.

## 1.2 Task

In this take-home exercise, we are tasked to predict HDB resale prices at the sub-market level (i.e. HDB 3-room, HDB 4-room and HDB 5-room) for the month of January and February 2023 in Singapore. The predictive models must be built by using by using conventional OLS method and GWR methods. You are also required to compare the performance of the conventional OLS method versus the geographical weighted methods.

# 

# 2.0 Importing and Wrangling of Aspatial Data

We use the `read_csv(`) function of readr package to import resale-flat-prices into R as a tibble data frame called resale. Further, `glimpse()` function of dplyr package is used to display the data structure.

::: panel-tabset
### Code

```{r}
resale <- read_csv("data/aspatial/resale-flat-prices.csv")
```

### Glimpse

```{r}
glimpse(resale)
```
:::

We can see the following information upon running the glimpse function -

-   The dataset contains 11 columns with 148,864 rows

-   The columns present are the following -

    -   month (month here is in the format of yyyy/mm)

    -   town

    -   flat_type

    -   block

    -   street_name

    -   storey_range

    -   floor_area_sqm

    -   flat_model

    -   lease_commence_date

    -   remaining_lease

    -   resale_price

-   The data is from Jan 2017 and consists of all flat types including Executive to 2,3,4 and 5 bedrooms. However, we will only be focusing only 4 bedroom and we need data from 1st January 2021 on wards till 31st December. Hence, we will be filtering the data

## 2.1 Filtering Resale Data

We will be using the `filter()` function of dplyr to select our flat_types and dates in **rs_subset**. We will also be using the unique() function to check if we have successfully extracted the flat_type and month.

::: panel-tabset
### Code

```{r}
rs_subset <-  filter(resale,flat_type == "4 ROOM") %>% 
              filter(month >= "2021-01" & month <= "2023-02")
```

### Glimpse

```{r}
glimpse(rs_subset)
```

### Unique_Month

```{r}
unique(rs_subset$month)
```

### Unique_Flat_type

```{r}
unique(rs_subset$flat_type)
```
:::

From the above results we can see that there are 23,656 transactions for 4 Bedroom flats from 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2022.

## 2.2 Transforming Resale Data Columns

We will be using the `mutate()` function to create a new variable called `rs_transform` with the following columns -

-   **address** : concatenation of the **block** and **street_name** columns using `paste()` function of base R package

-   **`remaining_lease_yr`** & **`remaining_lease_mth`**: we will split the **year** and **months** part of the **`remaining_lease`** respectively using `str_sub()` function of **stringr** package then converting the character to integer using `as.integer()` function of **base R** package

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
rs_transform <- rs_subset %>%
  mutate(rs_subset, address = paste(block,street_name)) %>%
  mutate(rs_subset, remaining_lease_yr = as.integer(str_sub(remaining_lease, 0, 2))) %>%
  mutate(rs_subset, remaining_lease_mth = as.integer(str_sub(remaining_lease, 9, 11)))
```

## Head

```{r}
head(rs_transform)
```
:::

## 2.3 Sum up remaining lease in months

There are some values in `remaining_lease_mth` which are NA. We will be first converting this NA values into 0 with the help of is.na() function. Upon doing this, we will convert the `remaining_lease_yr` into months by multiplying it by 12. We will replace these 2 columns by summing both these columns to create the `remaining_lease_mths` using `rowSums()` and `mutate()` functions. This columns will show the total remaining lease period in months.

```{r}
rs_transform$remaining_lease_mth[is.na(rs_transform$remaining_lease_mth)] <- 0
rs_transform$remaining_lease_yr <- rs_transform$remaining_lease_yr * 12
rs_transform <- rs_transform %>% 
  mutate(rs_transform, remaining_lease_mths = rowSums(rs_transform[, c("remaining_lease_yr", "remaining_lease_mth")])) %>%
  select(month, town, address, block, street_name, flat_type, storey_range, floor_area_sqm, flat_model, 
         lease_commence_date, remaining_lease_mths, resale_price)
```

## 2.4 Calculating Age of Unit

We need to find the age of the units, which we will do so by subtracting the respective lease_commence_date (in yyyy format) from the current year. We will then convert it into months for uniformity.

```{r}
rs_transform$unit_age_mths <- (2023 - rs_transform$lease_commence_date) * 12
```

## 2.4 Retrieval of Address

We will be retrieving data such as postal codes and coordinates of the address which will be essential in finding the proximity to locational factors.

### 2.4.1 Creating a list storing unique addresses

We will be using the `unique()` function of the base R package to extract unique addresses and then using the `sort()` function of base R package to sort the unique vectors. Further, we will be storing it in a list, so that we do not call the GET request more than required.

```{r}
add_list <- sort(unique(rs_transform$address))
```

### 2.4.2 Creating a function to retrieve coordinates from OneMap.sg API

We will be using the GET() function of httr package to make a GET request to <https://developers.onemap.sg/commonapi/search>. This allows us to query spatial data in a tidy format. The retrieved coordinates will be then be stored in a dataframe create called `postal_coords`. Further, we need to take note of the following variaboles which will be used in our `GET()` request.

-   **`searchVal`**: Keywords entered by user that is used to filter out the results.

-   **`returnGeom`** {Y/N}: Checks if user wants to return the geometry.

-   **`getAddrDetails`** {Y/N}: Checks if user wants to return address details for a point.

A thing to note is that the returned JSON response will contain multiple values, however, we are only interested in the postal code and coordinates like Longitude and Latitude. Further, we will create a dataframe `new_row` to store each final set of coordinates retrieved during the loop. We are creating this new dataframe so that we can check the number of responses returned and append to the `postal_coords` (using `r_bind()`) as some of the locations might have a single result of postal while the others might have multiple set of postal codes. Further, we also need to check if the address is invalid by looking at the number of rows returned (i.e. **found** = 0).

```{r}
get_coords <- function(add_list){
  
  # Create a data frame to store all retrieved coordinates
  postal_coords <- data.frame()
    
  for (i in add_list){
    #print(i)

    r <- GET('https://developers.onemap.sg/commonapi/search?',
           query=list(searchVal=i,
                     returnGeom='Y',
                     getAddrDetails='Y'))
    data <- fromJSON(rawToChar(r$content))
    found <- data$found
    res <- data$results
    
    # Create a new data frame for each address
    new_row <- data.frame()
    
    # If single result, append 
    if (found == 1){
      postal <- res$POSTAL 
      lat <- res$LATITUDE
      lng <- res$LONGITUDE
      new_row <- data.frame(address= i, postal = postal, latitude = lat, longitude = lng)
    }
    
    # If multiple results, drop NIL and append top 1
    else if (found > 1){
      # Remove those with NIL as postal
      res_sub <- res[res$POSTAL != "NIL", ]
      
      # Set as NA first if no Postal
      if (nrow(res_sub) == 0) {
          new_row <- data.frame(address= i, postal = NA, latitude = NA, longitude = NA)
      }
      
      else{
        top1 <- head(res_sub, n = 1)
        postal <- top1$POSTAL 
        lat <- top1$LATITUDE
        lng <- top1$LONGITUDE
        new_row <- data.frame(address= i, postal = postal, latitude = lat, longitude = lng)
      }
    }

    else {
      new_row <- data.frame(address= i, postal = NA, latitude = NA, longitude = NA)
    }
    
    # Add the row
    postal_coords <- rbind(postal_coords, new_row)
  }
  return(postal_coords)
}
```

### 2.4.3 Retrieve Resale Coordinates

```{r}
coords <- get_coords(add_list)
```

### 2.4.3 Check Results

We will be using the is.na() function of base R package to chekc if any of the relevant columns contain any NA values.

```{r}
coords[(is.na(coords$postal) | is.na(coords$latitude) | is.na(coords$longitude) | coords$postal=="NIL"), ]
```

From the above message, we can see that the postal code of 215 CHOA CHU KANG CTRL is missing. Upon searching it up online, we can see that the postal code is 680215.

![](images/image-27940901.png)

### 2.4.4 Combine Resale and Coordinates Data

We will now use the left_join() function of dplyr package combine the successfully retrieved coordinates with out transformed resale dataset.

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
rs_coords <- left_join(rs_transform, coords, by = c('address' = 'address'))
```

## Head

```{r}
head(rs_coords)
```
:::

### 

### 2.4.5 Handling NIL data

We now need to add the postal code of 215 CHOA CHU KANG CTRL. Since we can see from the below code, the postal code is not in integer, but in character, we will be replacing the NIL with the postal code in character type.

```{r}
typeof(rs_coords$postal)
```

```{r}
rs_coords[rs_coords$address == '215 CHOA CHU KANG CTRL', "postal"] <- "680215"
```

Lets verify that the postal code has been replaced and there are no more NA or NIL values.

```{r}
rs_coords[(is.na(rs_coords$postal) | is.na(rs_coords$latitude) | is.na(rs_coords$longitude) | rs_coords$postal=="NIL"), ]
```

### 2.4.6 Write file to RDS

Since, our subset resale dataset is now complete with the coordinates, we can save it into a rds file to prevent running the `GET()` function multiple times.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rs_coords_rds <- write_rds(rs_coords, "data/rds/rs_coords.rds")
```

Now lets read the RDS file to verify its saved properly.

::: panel-tabset
## Read

```{r}
rs_coords <- read_rds("data/rds/rs_coords.rds")
```

## Glimpse

```{r}
glimpse(rs_coords)
```
:::

### 2.4.7 Assign and Transform CRS

Since we are using Longitudes and Latitudes which are in decimals, the CRS will be WGS84. Hence, we will need to assign them first to EPSG code 4326 and then transform it to 3414 which is the EPSG code for SVY21 (Singapore).

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- st_as_sf(rs_coords,
                    coords = c("longitude", 
                               "latitude"),
                    crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

Now lets check that the CRS has been successfully transformed

```{r}
st_crs(rs_coords_sf)
```

### 2.4.8 Checking for Invalid Geometries

```{r}
length(which(st_is_valid(rs_coords_sf) == FALSE))
```

### 2.4.9 Plotting HDB Resale Points

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(rs_coords_sf)+
  tm_dots(col="blue", size = 0.02)
tmap_mode("plot")
```

# 3.0 Importing Geospatial Locational Factors

## 3.1 Locational Factors with Geographic Coordinates

We will begin with reading the simple features of the files and then retrieving coordinate reference system.

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
bus_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/BusStop.shp")
childcare_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/CHILDCARE.shp")
dengue_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/DENGUE_CLUSTER.shp")
elder_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/ELDERCARE.shp")
gym_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/gyms-sg.geojson")
hawker_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/hawker-centres-geojson.geojson")
kindergartens_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/KINDERGARTENS.shp") 
mrt_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/lta-mrt-station-exit-geojson.geojson")
privateInst_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/CPE_PEI_PREMISES.shp")
parks_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/NATIONALPARKS.shp")
preschools_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/PRESCHOOLS_LOCATION.shp")
supermarket_sf <- st_read("data/geospatial/SUPERMARKETS.shp") 

```

## Check CRS

```{r}
st_crs(bus_sf)
st_crs(childcare_sf)
st_crs(dengue_sf)
st_crs(elder_sf)
st_crs(gym_sf)
st_crs(hawker_sf)
st_crs(kindergartens_sf)
st_crs(mrt_sf)
st_crs(privateInst_sf)
st_crs(parks_sf)
st_crs(preschools_sf)
st_crs(supermarket_sf)
```
:::

As we can see, the following datasets have WGS84 as Geodetic CRS -

-   childcare_sf

-   gym_sf

-   hawker_sf

-   privateInst_sf

-   mrt_sf

The rest of the datasets have SVY21 as their Geodetic CRS, however, their EPSG code is 6326 which is wrong since the correct code for SYV21 for Singapore is 3414.

### 3.1.1 Assign the correct EPSG code to sf dataframes

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
childcare_sf <- childcare_sf %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
gym_sf <- gym_sf %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
hawker_sf <- hawker_sf %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
privateInst_sf <- privateInst_sf %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
mrt_sf <- mrt_sf %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)

bus_sf <- st_set_crs(bus_sf, 3414)
dengue_sf <- st_set_crs(dengue_sf, 3414)
elder_sf <- st_set_crs(elder_sf, 3414)
gym_sf <- st_set_crs(gym_sf, 3414)
kindergartens_sf <- st_set_crs(kindergartens_sf, 3414)
parks_sf <- st_set_crs(parks_sf, 3414)
preschools_sf <- st_set_crs(preschools_sf, 3414)
supermarket_sf <- st_set_crs(supermarket_sf, 3414)
```

## Verify CRS

```{r}
st_crs(childcare_sf)
st_crs(gym_sf)
st_crs(hawker_sf)
st_crs(privateInst_sf)
st_crs(bus_sf)
st_crs(dengue_sf)
st_crs(elder_sf)
st_crs(gym_sf)
st_crs(kindergartens_sf)
st_crs(mrt_sf)
st_crs(parks_sf)
st_crs(preschools_sf)
st_crs(supermarket_sf)
```
:::

All the datasets' CRS have been successfully changed and all have EPSG 3414.

### 3.1.2 Check for Invalid Geometries

Now that we have assigned the correct EPSG, we will now check for any invalid geometries using the `length()` and `st_is_valid()` function so that there won't be any failure later on.

```{r}
length(which(st_is_valid(bus_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(childcare_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(dengue_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(elder_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(gym_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(hawker_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(kindergartens_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(mrt_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(privateInst_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(parks_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(preschools_sf) == FALSE))
length(which(st_is_valid(supermarket_sf) == FALSE))
```

### 3.1.3 Calculating Proximity

We will begin with creating a Proximity function which will first create a matrix of distances between HDB and the locational factor using `st_distance()`. It will then use the `min()` function to find the minimum distance to get the nearest point of locational factor and then add it to HDB resale dataset using the `mutate()` function. It will then rename the column according to the input given so that the column names are unique and appropriate.

```{r}
get_prox <- function(origin_df, dest_df, col_name){
  
  # creates a matrix of distances
  dist_matrix <- st_distance(origin_df, dest_df)           
  
  # find the nearest location_factor and create new data frame
  near <- origin_df %>% 
    mutate(PROX = apply(dist_matrix, 1, function(x) min(x)) / 1000) 
  
  # rename column name according to input parameter
  names(near)[names(near) == 'PROX'] <- col_name

  # Return df
  return(near)

Now, lets call this function to calculate to get the proximity of resale HDB flats and these locational factors

### 3.1.4 Calculating number of factors within Distance

We will be creating a function which will create a matrix of distances between the HDB and the locational factor using the st_distance() function. It will then use the sum() function to get the count of locational factors which are within a given threshold and this will be added to the HDB resale data using mutate() function. This column will be named according to the input given by the user to that is unique and appropriate.

```{r}
get_within <- function(origin_df, dest_df, threshold_dist, col_name){
  
  # creates a matrix of distances
  dist_matrix <- st_distance(origin_df, dest_df)   
  
  # count the number of location_factors within threshold_dist and create new data frame
  wdist <- origin_df %>% 
    mutate(WITHIN_DT = apply(dist_matrix, 1, function(x) sum(x <= threshold_dist)))
  
  # rename column name according to input parameter
  names(wdist)[names(wdist) == 'WITHIN_DT'] <- col_name

  # Return df
  return(wdist)
  
}
```

We need to find the count of locational factors within the given distance as per requirement for the following factors -

-   Kindergartens - 350m

-   Childcare centers - 350m

-   Bus stops - 350m

-   Primary School - 1km

-   Preschools - 1km (additional)

-   Private Institutes - 1km (additional)

Note - We are yet to pre-process the data for Primary Schools, so we will be finding the number of Primary Schools within 1km later.

::: panel-tabset
## Kindergartens

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_within(rs_coords_sf, kindergartens_sf, 350, "Within_350M_Kindergarten")
```

## Childcare Centers

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_within(rs_coords_sf, childcare_sf, 350, "Within_350M_ChildCare")
```

## Bus Stops

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_within(rs_coords_sf, bus_sf, 350, "Within_350M_BusStops")
```

## Preschools

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_within(rs_coords_sf, preschools_sf, 1000, "Within_1KM_PreSchools")
```

## Private Institutes

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_within(rs_coords_sf, privateInst_sf, 1000, "Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute")
```
:::

## 3.2 Locational Factors without Geographic Coordinates

We will now begin with pre-processing data for which we don't have geographic coordinates.

### 3.2.1 CBD Area

Upon doing some research, we can refer to 'Downtown Core' as the Central Business District (CBD) area. From the [LatLong.net](https://www.latlong.net/place/downtown-core-singapore-20616.html) , we get the longitude (**1.287953**) and latitude (**103.851784**) of CBD.

So now that we have the longitude and latitude, all we need to do is convert it to EPSG 3414 (SVY21) format before we run the get_prox function.

```{r}
name <- c('CBD Area')
latitude= c(1.287953)
longitude= c(103.851784)
cbd_coords <- data.frame(name, latitude, longitude)
```

```{r}
cbd_coords_sf <- st_as_sf(cbd_coords,
                    coords = c("longitude", 
                               "latitude"),
                    crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

```{r}
st_crs(cbd_coords_sf)
```

Now that we have verified the CRS is in the correct format, we can run the get_proximity function to calculate the proximity of the HDBs to the CBD area.

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_prox(rs_coords_sf, cbd_coords_sf, "PROX_CBD") 
```

### 3.2.2 Shopping Malls

```{r}
shopping_malls <- read_csv("data/geospatial/shopping_malls.csv")
glimpse(shopping_malls)
```

```{r}
shopping_sf <- st_as_sf(shopping_malls,
                              coords = c("longitude",
                                         "latitude"),
                              crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

```{r}
st_crs(shopping_sf)
```

Lets check for an invalid geometries so that we do not run into errors later when we calculate the proximity or plot the map.

```{r}
length(which(!st_is_valid(shopping_sf)))
```

As we can see there are no invalid geometries. And since we have verified the CRS is in the correct format, we can run the get_proximity function to calculate the proximity of the HDBs to shopping malls.

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_prox(rs_coords_sf, shopping_sf, "PROX_ShoppingMalls") 
```

### 

### 3.2.3 Primary Schools

First lets read the CSV file containing all the schools in Singapore.

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
pri_schl <- read_csv("data/geospatial/general-information-of-schools.csv")
```

## Glimpse

```{r}
glimpse(pri_schl)
```
:::

We can see that we have "mainlevel_code" which categorizes as "primary, secondary, mixed levels, junior college". So lets filter out and extract Primary School as per requirement.

::: panel-tabset
## Primary School

```{r}
pri_schl <- pri_schl %>%
  filter(mainlevel_code == "PRIMARY") %>%
  select(school_name, address, postal_code, mainlevel_code)
```

## Glimpse

```{r}
glimpse(pri_schl)
```
:::

We can see that there are 183 Primary Schools in Singapore. Lets create a list storing the postal codes and then retrieve the coordinates of these postal codes.

```{r}
# List to store the postal codes
prisch_list <- sort(unique(pri_schl$postal_code))
# Calling the get_coords() function to retrieve the coordinates of the primary schools
prisch_coords <- get_coords(prisch_list)
```

Now lets ensure that there are no NA values

```{r}
prisch_coords[(is.na(prisch_coords$postal) | is.na(prisch_coords$latitude) | is.na(prisch_coords$longitude)), ]
```

As we can see there are no values with NA values, so we can proceed to combine the coordinates with their respective primary school names

```{r}
prisch_coords = prisch_coords[c("postal","latitude", "longitude")]
pri_schl <- left_join(pri_schl, prisch_coords, by = c('postal_code' = 'postal'))
```

Lets take a look at the dataframe now

```{r}
pri_schl
```

Now that we have combines the dataframes, lets convert it to a sf object and assign and transform its CRS

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
prisch_sf <- st_as_sf(pri_schl,
                    coords = c("longitude", 
                               "latitude"),
                    crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

## Check CRS

```{r}
st_crs(prisch_sf)
```
:::

Now lets find the number of schools within 1KM of HDB resales using the `get_within()` function

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_within(rs_coords_sf, prisch_sf, 1000, "Within_1KM_PriSchl")
```

### 3.2.4 Good Primary Schools (Top 10)

Based on [Salary.sg](https://www.salary.sg/2022/best-primary-schools-2022-by-popularity/), the below list are the top 10 primary schools in Singapore

```{r}
url <- "https://www.salary.sg/2021/best-primary-schools-2021-by-popularity/"

good_pri <- data.frame()

schools <- read_html(url) %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = paste('//*[@id="post-3068"]/div[3]/div/div/ol/li') ) %>%
  html_text() 

for (i in (schools)){
  sch_name <- toupper(gsub(" – .*","",i))
  sch_name <- gsub("\\(PRIMARY SECTION)","",sch_name)
  sch_name <- trimws(sch_name)
  new_row <- data.frame(pri_sch_name=sch_name)
  # Add the row
  good_pri <- rbind(good_pri, new_row)
}

top_good_pri <- head(good_pri, 10)
```

Now that we have got the top 10 primary school, lets check that the names in `top_good_pri` are the same as that in `pri_schl`.

```{r}
top_good_pri$pri_sch_name[!top_good_pri$pri_sch_name %in% prisch_sf$school_name]
```

As we see, the below listed schools are not the same.

-   Chij St. Nicholas Girl's School

-   Catholic High School

-   St. Hilda's Primary School

This is because the first 2 school are 'Mixed Levels', as a result we need to use get_coords() to get their coordinates. However, upon closely investigating as to why St. Hilda's Primary School is not shown in prisch_sf despite it being a primary school, I realized that it is because " ' " is different in both and hence, this needs to be changed.

```{r}
top_good_pri$pri_sch_name[top_good_pri$pri_sch_name == "ST. HILDA’S PRIMARY SCHOOL"] <- "ST. HILDA'S PRIMARY SCHOOL"
```

```{r}
top_good_pri$pri_sch_name[!top_good_pri$pri_sch_name %in% prisch_sf$school_name]
```

As we can see we have rectified that. Now lets get the use get_coords() to get the coordinates.

```{r}
goodprisch_coords <- get_coords(unique(top_good_pri$pri_sch_name))
```

Lets check if any of the values have NA.

```{r}
goodprisch_coords[(is.na(goodprisch_coords$postal) | is.na(goodprisch_coords$latitude) | is.na(goodprisch_coords$longitude)), ]
```

None of the values have NA and hence, we can proceed to convert it to sf dataframe and assign and transform it to the correct CRS.

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
goodprischl_sf <- st_as_sf(goodprisch_coords,
                    coords = c("longitude", 
                               "latitude"),
                    crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

## Check CRS

```{r}
st_crs(goodprischl_sf)
```
:::

Now that we have verified the CRS, lets calculate the proximity of HDB and Good Primary schools using the `get_proximity()` function.

```{r}
rs_coords_sf <- get_prox(rs_coords_sf, goodprischl_sf, "PROX_GoodPriSchls")
```

### 3.2.5 Write to RDS

Now that we our resale subset data is complete with all the locational factors, we can now save it into an rds file.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rs_factors_rds <- write_rds(rs_coords_sf, "data/rds/rs_factors.rds")
```

# 4.0 Geospatial Data

Lets import the Master Plan 2019 Subzone data

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MPSZ-2019")
```

We can see that the Geodetic CRS is WGS 84, hence we need to change it.

::: panel-tabset
## Transform CRS

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_transform(mpsz_sf, 3414)
```

## Check CRS

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz_sf)
```
:::

Now, that we have verified the CRS, lets check for invalid variables

```{r}
length(which(st_is_valid(mpsz_sf) == FALSE))
```

We can see that that there are 6 invalid geometries. Lets rectify that!

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_make_valid(mpsz_sf)
length(which(st_is_valid(mpsz_sf) == FALSE))
```

# 5.0 Resale with Locational Factors

Lets look into the rds file we created.

```{r}
rs_sf <- read_rds("data/rds/rs_factors.rds")
```

```{r}
glimpse(rs_sf)
```

As we take a deeper look into our sf, we can see that the column name **storey_range** has data in characters with each value being in a range. Hence, this data can be a **categorical variable**! (Categorical variables represent types of data which may be divided into groups).

When categorical variables are used in regression analysis, they need to be carefully used as regression models require numerical input variables to make predictions. Hence categorical variables (storey_range in our case) can't be use directly. It needs to be transformed into numerical variables using encoding techniques like dummy coding or one-hot code encoding.

However, in our case our variable can be ordered from low to high as the storey_range have a meaning. Flats at a higher storey_range will be more pricier compared to that of a lower one. This will affect the price of the HDS resale price. Hence, instead of using dummy coding method, we will be using sorting the storey_range categorical variable and assigning numerical values in ascending order.

## 5.1 Extract the sorted unique storay_range

```{r}
storeys <- sort(unique(rs_sf$storey_range))
```

## 5.2 Create a dataframe to store order

```{r}
storey_order <- 1:length(storeys)
storey_range_order <- data.frame(storeys, storey_order)
```

Now lets take a look into the dataframe created

```{r}
head(storey_range_order)
```

As we can see the storeys are correctly assigned to the storey_order in an ascending manner.

## 5.3 Combine the Storeys order to Resale

```{r}
rs_sf <- left_join(rs_sf, storey_range_order, by= c("storey_range" = "storeys"))
```

## 5.4 Select Required Columns for Analysis

Now lets drop the unrequired columns and only select the required columns necessary for anlaysis.

```{r}
rs_req <- rs_sf %>%
  select(month, resale_price, floor_area_sqm, storey_order, remaining_lease_mths, unit_age_mths, PROX_BusStops, PROX_ChildCare, PROX_Dengue, PROX_ElderCare, PROX_Gym,
         PROX_HawkerCentre, PROX_Kindergartens, PROX_PrivateInstitutes, PROX_Parks, PROX_PreSchools, PROX_Supermarket, Within_350M_Kindergarten, Within_350M_ChildCare, Within_350M_BusStops, Within_1KM_PreSchools, Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute, PROX_CBD, PROX_ShoppingMalls, Within_1KM_PriSchl, PROX_GoodPriSchls, PROX_MRT)
```

```{r}
summary(rs_req)
```

Now lets write this into a rds file for easier access of data

```{r}
#| eval: fals
resale_final <- write_rds(rs_req, "data/rds/resale_final.rds")
```

# 6.0 Exploratory Data Analysis

## 6.1 Plot Historgram of Resale Prices

```{r}
ggplot(data=rs_req, aes(x=`resale_price`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light coral") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of 4-Room Resale Prices",
       x = "Resale Prices",
       y = "Frequency")
```

From the above graph, we can see that the graph is skewed to the right, implying that more HDB units were sold at relative lower prices. Majority of the HDBs were sold around \$500,000.

## 6.2 Plotting multiple histogram distribution of variables

### 6.2.1 Structural Factors

Extract the following columns names to plot - Area of the unit, Floor Level, Remaining Lease, Age of the unit

```{r}
s_factor <- c("floor_area_sqm", "storey_order", "remaining_lease_mths", "unit_age_mths")
```

Now lets create a function which will create a vector `s_factor_hist_list` of the size of our structural factors. The function will then plot a histogram for each structural factor and append it to the vector.

```{r}
s_factor_hist_list <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(s_factor))
for (i in 1:length(s_factor)) {
  hist_plot <- ggplot(rs_req, aes_string(x = s_factor[[i]])) +
    geom_histogram(color="firebrick", fill = "light coral") +
    labs(title = s_factor[[i]]) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10),
          axis.title = element_blank())
  
  s_factor_hist_list[[i]] <- hist_plot
}
```

Now, lets run the function and plot the histrograms for our structural factors!

```{r}
ggarrange(plotlist = s_factor_hist_list,
          ncol = 2,
          nrow = 2)
```

*From the above results, we can see that -*

-   *Only the `floor_area_sqm` resembles a normal distribution*

-   *`storey_order` is left skewed. This means that there are higher resale in HDBs in this periods for flats on lower storeys.*

-   *`remaining_lease_mths` is right skewed with the 3 peaks near 700, 900 and 1100 months. This suggests that there are generally 3 clusters of resale HDBs that are transacted with 62 years, 75 years and 91 years remaining, with the 3rd cluster having the highest number of resale HDBs.*

-   *unit_age_mths also has 3 peaks near 100, 300 and 450 months. This suggests that there are generally 3 clusters of resale HDBs that are trasacted at the age of 8, 25 and 37.5 years, with the first cluster (8 years) having the highest number of resale HDBs.*

### 6.2.2 Locational Factors

Extract the following columns names to plot -

```{r}
l_factor <- c("PROX_BusStops", "PROX_ChildCare", "PROX_Dengue", "PROX_ElderCare", "PROX_Gym", "PROX_HawkerCentre", "PROX_Kindergartens", "PROX_MRT", "PROX_PrivateInstitutes", "PROX_Parks", "PROX_PreSchools", "PROX_Supermarket", "PROX_CBD", "PROX_ShoppingMalls", "PROX_GoodPriSchls", "Within_350M_Kindergarten", "Within_350M_ChildCare", "Within_350M_BusStops", "Within_1KM_PreSchools", "Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute", "Within_1KM_PriSchl")
```

Now lets create a function which will create a vector `l_factor_hist_list` of the size of our locational factors. The function will then plot a histogram for each locational factor and append it to the vector.

```{r}
l_factor_hist_list <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(l_factor))
for (i in 1:length(l_factor)) {
  hist_plot <- ggplot(rs_req, aes_string(x = l_factor[[i]])) +
    geom_histogram(bins=30, color="midnight blue", fill = "light sky blue") +
    labs(title = l_factor[[i]]) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10),
          axis.title = element_blank())
  
  l_factor_hist_list[[i]] <- hist_plot
}
```

Now, lets run the function and plot the histrograms for our locational factors!

```{r}
ggarrange(plotlist = l_factor_hist_list,
          ncol = 3,
          nrow = 4)
```

*From the above plots, we can see that*

-   *PROX_BusStops, PROX_ChildCare, PROX_Dengue, PROX_ElderCare, PROX_Gym, PROX_HawkerCentre, PROX_MRT, PROX_PrivateInstitutes, PROX_PreSchools, PROX_Supermarkets, PROX_ShoppingMalls are right skewed distribution.*

-   *PROX_Parks, PROX_Kindergartens is normally distributed.*

-   *PROX_CBD is a little left skewed.*

-   *PROX_GoodPriSchls has 2 peaks. This means that there are 2 clusters of resale HDBs that are transacted at a proximity of 3 and 6 Primary Schools with more resale HDBs transacted with a proximity of 6 Primary Schools.*

-   *Within_350M_Kindergartens is right skewed with highest cluster at 1 school near the resale HDBs.*

-   *Within_350M_Childcare and Within_350M_BusStops, Within_1KM_PreSchools and Within_1KM_PriSchl are normally distributed.*

-   *Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute is left skewed distribution.*

**ELABORATE AND EXPLAIN PROPERLYY!!!!**

## 6.3 Statistical Point Map

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(rs_sf) +  
  tm_dots(col = "resale_price",
          alpha = 0.6,
          style="quantile") +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14)) +
tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

*From the interactive map, we can see that 4 room HDBs in the Central and Northeast region seem to have higher resale prices, as indicated by the darker orange points. This is in comparison to the lighter yellow points concentrated around the North and West area.*

# 7.0 Prepping for Predictive Model

## 7.1 Reading Data File into RDS and Sampling

```{r}
resale_final <- read_rds("data/rds/resale_final.rds")
```

Now we need to split the data into training and testing data sets. For our assignment, our training data is 1st January 2022 to 31st December 2022 while our training data is data between January and February 2023. I have reduce the training data set due to high computation power it requires.

```{r}
train_data <- resale_final %>% filter(month >= "2022-01" & month <= "2022-12")
test_data <- resale_final %>% filter(month >= "2023-01" & month <= "2023-02")
```

```{r}
#| eval: fals
write_rds(train_data, "data/rds/train_data.rds")
write_rds(test_data, "data/rds/test_data.rds")
```

## 7.2 Computing Correlation Matrix

Before loading the predictors into a predictive model, it is always a good practice to use correlation matrix to examine if there is sign of multicolinearity.

```{r}
resale_nogeo <- resale_final %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
corrplot::corrplot(cor(resale_nogeo[, 2:17]), 
                   diag = FALSE, 
                   order = "AOE",
                   tl.pos = "td", 
                   tl.cex = 0.5, 
                   method = "number", 
                   type = "upper")
```

*The correlation matrix shows that the correlation value between* `PROX_PreSchools` *and* `PROX_Childcare` *is 0.88 \> 0.8 which indicate a high positive correlation. This could be because some childcare centers may be considered as Pre_Schools. Hence, we will drop* '`PROX_ChildCare`'.

*Further, the correlation matrix shows that the correlation value* `unit_age_mths` *and remaining_lease_mths is -1.0. This is because remaining_lease_mths is basically unit_age_mths subtracted from lease period amount allowed. Hence, they are negatively correlated as when Age of Unit increases, the Remaining Lease period will decrease. Hence, we will drop* `unit_age_mths`.

# 8.0 Non-Spatial Multiple Linear Regression

First lets retrieve the stored data

```{r}
train_data <- read_rds("data/rds/train_data.rds")
test_data <- read_rds("data/rds/test_data.rds")
```

A non-spatial Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is a conventional OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method. The model is used to analyze the linear relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables in a non-spatial setting. OLS is one of the most commonly used methods to estimate the parameters in MLR, where the goal is to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable. The use of OLS in non-spatial MLR assumes that the residuals are independent and identically distributed (IID), and the model assumptions, such as linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity, hold.

Now lets prepare the Publication Quality Table using olsrr method.

```{r}
#| eval: false
price_mlr <- lm(resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm +
                  storey_order + remaining_lease_mths + PROX_BusStops + 
                  PROX_Dengue + PROX_ElderCare + PROX_Gym +
         PROX_HawkerCentre + PROX_Kindergartens + PROX_PrivateInstitutes + PROX_Parks + PROX_PreSchools + PROX_Supermarket + Within_350M_Kindergarten + Within_350M_ChildCare + Within_350M_BusStops + Within_1KM_PreSchools + Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute + PROX_CBD + PROX_ShoppingMalls + Within_1KM_PriSchl + PROX_GoodPriSchls + PROX_MRT,
                data=train_data)
summary(price_mlr)
```

Lets write the data into a RDS file to save the output.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(price_mlr, "data/rds/price_mlr.rds")
```

```{r}
price_mlr <- read_rds("data/rds/price_mlr.rds")
```

Now lets looks at the results.

```{r}
ols_regress(price_mlr)
```

We will now use the [tbl_regression()](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtsummary/vignettes/tbl_regression.html) function of gtsummary package. The function takes a regression model in R and returns a formatted table of regression model results that is publication-ready. It is a simple way to summarize and present your analysis results using R!

```{r}
tbl_regression(price_mlr, intercept = TRUE)
```

*The coefficients represent the amount of change in the dependent variable (resale_price) for each unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other variables constant. When the coefficient is positive, it means that there is a positive linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable. For example, the coefficient for floor_area_sqm is positive, it means that as the floor area of a property increases, the resale price also tends to increase.*

*When the coefficient is negative, it means that there is a negative linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable. For example, when the coefficient for PROX_MRT is negative, it means that as the proximity to MRT increases, the resale price tends to decrease.*

*However, this is only significant if the p-value \< 0.05. Every independent variable except for PROX_BusStops, PROX_PreSchools, Within_350M_Kindergarten, PROX_ShoppingMalls are insignificant.*

## 8.1 Test for signs of **multicolinearity**

```{r}
ols_vif_tol(price_mlr)
```

*Since the VIF of the independent variables are less than 10. We can safely conclude that there are no sign of multicollinearity among the independent variables.*

## 8.2 Test for **Non-Linearity**

```{r}
ols_plot_resid_fit(price_mlr)
```

*The figure above reveals that most of the data points are scattered around the 0 line, hence we can safely conclude that the relationships between the resale price and independent variables are linear.*

## 8.3 Test for **Normality Assumption**

```{r}
ols_plot_resid_hist(price_mlr)
```

*The figure reveals that the residual of the multiple linear regression model (i.e. price_mlr) resembles normal distribution.*

## 8.4 Predicting by using Test Data

We will use predict() function to predict the resale value by using the test data and price_mlr model calibrated earlier.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mlr_pred <- predict(price_mlr, 
                    newdata = test_data, 
                    interval = 'confidence')
```

Lets save the output into a rds file

```{r}
#| eval: false
MLR_pred <- write_rds(mlr_pred, "data/rds/mlr_pred.rds")
```

The output of the `predict()` is a vector of predicted values. So lets convert it into a data frame for further visualisation and analysis.

```{r}
MLR_pred <- read_rds("data/rds/mlr_pred.rds")
MLR_pred_df <- as.data.frame(MLR_pred)
```

Lets append the predicted values into test data

```{r}
test_data_mlr <- cbind(test_data, MLR_pred_df)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(test_data_mlr, "data/rds/test_data_mlr.rds")
```

## 8.5 Calculating Root Mean Square Error

The root mean square error (RMSE) allows us to measure how far predicted values are from observed values in a regression analysis.

```{r}
glimpse(test_data_mlr)
```

```{r}
rmse(test_data_mlr$resale_price, 
     test_data_mlr$fit)
```

## 8.6 Visualising the Predicted Values

Lets plot a scatterplot to visualise the actual resale price and the predicted resale price.

```{r}
ggplot(data = test_data_mlr,
       aes(x = fit,
           y = resale_price)) +
  geom_point()
```

# 9.0 GWR Predictive Method

We will now calibrate a model to predict HDB resale price by using geographically weighted regression method of [**GWmodel**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWmodel/) package.

## 9.1 Converting sf dataframe to SpatialPointDataframe

```{r}
train_data_sp <- as_Spatial(train_data)
train_data_sp
```

## 9.2 Computing Adaptive Bandwidth

We will use `bw.gwr()` of **GWmodel** package to determine the optimal bandwidth to be used.

```{r}
#| eval: false
price_bwAdapt <- bw.gwr(resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm +
                  storey_order + remaining_lease_mths + PROX_BusStops + 
                  PROX_Dengue + PROX_ElderCare + PROX_Gym +
         PROX_HawkerCentre + PROX_Kindergartens + PROX_PrivateInstitutes + PROX_Parks + PROX_PreSchools + PROX_Supermarket + Within_350M_Kindergarten + Within_350M_ChildCare + Within_350M_BusStops + Within_1KM_PreSchools + Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute + PROX_CBD + PROX_ShoppingMalls + Within_1KM_PriSchl + PROX_GoodPriSchls + PROX_MRT,
                data=train_data_sp,
                approach="CV",
                kernel="gaussian",
                adaptive=TRUE,
                longlat=FALSE)
summary(price_bwAdapt)
```

![CV Result](images/Screenshot%202023-03-25%20160940.png){fig-align="center"}

The result shows that 61 meters will be the optimal bandwidth to be used if adaptive bandwidth is used for this data set as the smallest CV score is adaptive bandwidth: 61.

Now lets save the output into a rds file so that we don't have to run this computing intensive code again.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(price_bwAdapt, "data/rds/price_bwAdapt.rds")
```

## 9.3 Construct the Adaptive Bandwidth GWR Model

First, let us call the save bandwidth by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
price_bwAdapt <- read_rds("data/rds/price_bwAdapt.rds")
```

Now, lets calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and Gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
price_gwrAdapt <- gwr.basic(formula = resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm +
                  storey_order + remaining_lease_mths + PROX_BusStops + 
                  PROX_Dengue + PROX_ElderCare + PROX_Gym +
         PROX_HawkerCentre + PROX_Kindergartens + PROX_PrivateInstitutes + PROX_Parks + PROX_PreSchools + PROX_Supermarket + Within_350M_Kindergarten + Within_350M_ChildCare + Within_350M_BusStops + Within_1KM_PreSchools + Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute + PROX_CBD + PROX_ShoppingMalls + Within_1KM_PriSchl + PROX_GoodPriSchls + PROX_MRT,
                data=train_data_sp,
                bw = price_bwAdapt,
                kernel="gaussian",
                adaptive=TRUE,
                longlat=FALSE)
summary(price_gwrAdapt)
```

Now lets write the output into a rds file so that we don't have to re-run the above code all the time.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(price_gwrAdapt, "data/rds/price_gwrAdapt.rds")
```

Now lets view the model output.

```{r}
price_gwrAdapt <- read_rds("data/rds/price_gwrAdapt.rds")
price_gwrAdapt
```

**HOW DO I EXPLAIN THISSS RESULTT???? IDKK!?!?!?!?!?!!?**

## 9.4 Preparing Coordinates Data

### 9.4.1 Extracting coordinates data

Now lets extract the x,y coordinates of the full, training and test data sets.

```{r}
coords <- st_coordinates(resale_final)
coords_train <- st_coordinates(train_data)
coords_test <- st_coordinates(test_data)
```

Lets write the output into a rds file for future reference

```{r}
#| eval: false
coords_train <- write_rds(coords_train, "data/rds/coords_train.rds" )
coords_test <- write_rds(coords_test, "data/rds/coords_test.rds" )
```

### 9.4.2 Dropping Geometry Field

We will now drop geometry column of the sf data.frame by using `st_drop_geometry()` of sf package.

```{r}
train_data <- train_data %>% 
  st_drop_geometry()
```

## 9.5 Calibrating Geographical Random Forest Model

We will now calibrate a model, using the training data to predict HDB resale price by calibrating a geographic random forest model.

Before we begin with that, we need to first find the bandwidth.

```{r}
#| eval: false
price_bw <- grf.bw(formula = resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm +
                  storey_order + remaining_lease_mths + PROX_BusStops + 
                  PROX_Dengue + PROX_ElderCare + PROX_Gym +
         PROX_HawkerCentre + PROX_Kindergartens + PROX_PrivateInstitutes + PROX_Parks + PROX_PreSchools + PROX_Supermarket + Within_350M_Kindergarten + Within_350M_ChildCare + Within_350M_BusStops + Within_1KM_PreSchools + Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute + PROX_CBD + PROX_ShoppingMalls + Within_1KM_PriSchl + PROX_GoodPriSchls + PROX_MRT,
                data=train_data,
                kernel="adaptive",
                coords=coords_train)
```

![](images/Screenshot%202023-03-25%20182112.png){fig-align="center"}

Based on the above output, we can see that the bandwidth for the Geographical Random Forest Model should be 556.

```{r}
#| eval: false
set.seed(1234)
price_gwRFadapt <- grf(formula = resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm +
                  storey_order + remaining_lease_mths + PROX_BusStops + 
                  PROX_Dengue + PROX_ElderCare + PROX_Gym +
         PROX_HawkerCentre + PROX_Kindergartens + PROX_PrivateInstitutes + PROX_Parks + PROX_PreSchools + PROX_Supermarket + Within_350M_Kindergarten + Within_350M_ChildCare + Within_350M_BusStops + Within_1KM_PreSchools + Within_1KM_PrivateInstitute + PROX_CBD + PROX_ShoppingMalls + Within_1KM_PriSchl + PROX_GoodPriSchls + PROX_MRT,
                dframe=train_data,
                ntree = 30,
                bw = 556,
                kernel="adaptive",
                coords=coords_train)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(price_gwRFadapt, "data/rds/price_gwRFadapt.rds")
```

**HOWW DOO I EXPLAIN THIS RESULLTT???**

```{r}
price_gwRFadapt <- read_rds("data/rds/price_gwRFadapt.rds")
```

## 9.6 Predicting by using Test Data

First, lets combine the test data with its corresponding coordinates data.

```{r}
test_data <- cbind(test_data, coords_test) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
```

Now, we will use predict.grf() function to predict the resale value by using the test data and price_gwRFadapt model calibrated earlier.

```{r}
#| eval: false
gwRF_pred <- predict.grf(price_gwRFadapt, 
                           test_data, 
                           x.var.name="X",
                           y.var.name="Y", 
                           local.w=1,
                           global.w=0)
```

Lets save the output into a rds file so that we don't have to re-run above code chunk again.

```{r}
#| eval: false
GRF_pred <- write_rds(gwRF_pred, "data/rds/GRF_pred.rds")
```

The output of the `predict.grf()` is a vector of predicted values. So lets convert it into a data frame for further visualisation and analysis.

```{r}
GRF_pred <- read_rds("data/rds/GRF_pred.rds")
GRF_pred_df <- as.data.frame(GRF_pred)
```

Lets append the predicted values onto test_data.

```{r}
test_data_p <- cbind(test_data, GRF_pred_df)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(test_data_p, "data/rds/test_data_p.rds")
```

## 9.7 Calculating Root Mean Square Error

The root mean square error (RMSE) allows us to measure how far predicted values are from observed values in a regression analysis.

```{r}
glimpse(test_data_p)
```

```{r}
rmse(test_data_p$resale_price, 
     test_data_p$GRF_pred)
```

## 9.8 Visualising the Predicted Values

Lets plot a scatterplot to visualise the actual resale price and the predicted resale price.

```{r}
ggplot(data = test_data_p,
       aes(x = GRF_pred,
           y = resale_price)) +
  geom_point()
```

# 10.0 Comparing OLS and GWR Method

OLS assumes that the relationship between dependent and independent variable is constant throughout the area, whereas, GWR allows for the relationship between the variables to vary across the space. Further, OLS assumes that the residuals are independent and indetically distributed (IID). However, spatial data often violates the IID assumption because neighbouring observations are often correlated. This is where GWR comes in as it is specifically designed to account for spatial diependence by considering the local neighbourhood around each observation.

Lets look at RMSE. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of predictive models. It measures the average distance between the predicted values and the actual value. A lower RMSE indicates better performance of the predictive model, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the actual values. For the OLS method is 62652.76 whereas for GWR method, the RMSE method is 36299.81, which is almost half of the rmse of the OLS method. This is one of the reason indicating GWR method is a better predictive method than OLS method.
Further, when we look at [8.6 Visualising the Predicted Values] and [9.8 Visualising the Predicted Values], we can see how the relation between the actual resale price and fit for OLS method is not linear. The points are more distributed as the fit increases, suggesting decrease in correctly predicted values. Whereas, the relation between resale price and the predicted resale value has a linear relation, indicating a more accurate prediction of resale price. This once again displays why GWR is a better predictive method than OLS.
