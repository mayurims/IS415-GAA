If not, we need to install it automatically. The below code checks if the packages are already installed, else it will install the packages for us. However, before running the below code, ensure that ‘packman’ package has been installed in your RStudio.\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, funModeling)\n\n\n\nImporting the Geospatial Dataset\nTo Import the Geospatial data, run the following code.
